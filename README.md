## Goals & Inspiration

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how to use Postgres for everything.

It's inspired by [this article](https://www.amazingcto.com/postgres-for-everything/)
[Amazing CTO](https://www.amazingcto.com/) as well as [this GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/cpursley/c8fb81fe8a7e5df038158bdfe0f06dbb)
from [@cpursley](https://gist.github.com/cpursley).

I wanted a place to collect contributions from anyone to keep track of all the
different ways Postgres can be used.
